<b>Cube's Edge</b>



Cube's Edge is a mod resuming the movements of the famous game : Mirror's Edge.

Mirror's Edge, for those who don't know, is a game of platform/action/adventure where you embody a person who moves thanks to roofs. For example: run on wall, jump on facades, etc.


With this mod, you will can :

    Go up in more four block only by jumping
    To grab you on the block if you fall
    Jump on walls
    Make rolls if you fall from too high
    Run faster and faster and go farther
    Slow down the game (Key R by default)
    Slide to pass below blocks
    Turn around and then jump (Key Â² by default)
    And then admire the future animations of the mod !
